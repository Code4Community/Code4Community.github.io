# Tutorial XYZ: React and JSX

By: Anden Acitelli

Reviewed by: 

## Prerequisite Knowledge

**Required Knowledge**
- JavaScript: React is written in JavaScript. You will have to at least have the syntax down to understand React. I also recommend you know HTTP Requests and the array functions JavaScript offers (especially `map`) which are used very frequently throughout JSX. 

**Recommended Knowledge** 
- HTML/CSS: While not really a prerequisite to actually work with React, especially the parts where we interface with the backend, you will want to understand how to do Front-End Design with HTML/CSS, otherwise much of the templating and front-end specific stuff will be much more challenging. 

## Setup

To use React, you will need:
- [Node](https://nodejs.org), which is likely already installed as part of previous tutorials
- npm (node package manager), which comes installed with Node.
