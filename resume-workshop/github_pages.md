# Resume Workshop - Enabling GitHub Pages

1. So, now that the code for the template you want is in your own repository, not only can you make changes to it, but you can also use it as your own publicly accessible website. 
    * That’s what we’re going to do here. We will expose this template as a publicly accessible website using GitHub’s built-in web hosting service, “GitHub Pages”
    * After the website is published, we can go back and edit its content to make it your own.
2. Click the ‘Settings’ tab in the top bar of the repository in your own GitHub account
    * Top of the page should read [your user name]/[theme name]
3. Scroll down to the ‘Github Pages’ section of the settings. It should look like the below:
4. Select where it says ‘None’ and choose ‘master’ instead.
    * Click ‘Save’
    * Wait ~2-3 minutes and then your website will be available at http://yourusername.github.io/your_repository_name
    * Navigate to that URL and you should see the template in action
