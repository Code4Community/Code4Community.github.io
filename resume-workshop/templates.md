# Resume Workshop - Templates
## Step 1: Find a template you like and fork in
* The links below are for website templates. Follow along with the Swiss template or, if you’re feeling adventurous, choose one of the other themes that you like.
* The most extensive directions are for the Swiss template:
    * [Swiss](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss)
* We also have some directions for the following two themes:
    * [Forty](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme)
    * [Minimal Resume](https://github.com/murraco/jekyll-theme-minimal-resume)
* The same principles discussed apply to the three themes below:
    * [Kross](https://github.com/themefisher/kross-jekyll)
    * [Console](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console)
    * [Creative](https://github.com/volny/creative-theme-jekyll)

### Directions
1. In the far upper-right-hand corner of the page, you should find a button labeled “Fork”.
    * Click the “Fork” button at the top right of the repo. You should see a modal pop up over your screen asking “Where should we fork swiss?” Immediately below that you should see your username. Click your own username to fork the repository containing your theme to your own GitHub account
        * If you don’t see your own username, check to make sure you are signed in. If not, sign in to GitHub using your credentials and try again.
    * So, what the heck did we just do? 
        * The code for making the generic website template you chose is stored in a GitHub Repository (a “repo”), which is like a folder for code. 
        * Forking the repository to your own GitHub account makes a repository that you own, on your account, filled with a copy of all of the code from the template repository
        * You can now edit this code and your changes can be saved to your own copy of the template. That’s exactly what we’re going to do to make this website your own.
        * You should end up with something like this where it should be [your github username]/swiss in the top left hand corner.
