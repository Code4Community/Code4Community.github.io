# Resume Workshop - Making Content Changes (Modifying Markdown and HTML)

## Title and Header Changes
1. So, let’s start by changing the title of the page from “Swiss Jekyll Theme” to “Hi, I’m [firstname] [lastname]”
2. The title and other content is stored in a configuration file named _config.yml
3. Click on the file _config.yml in the list of files
    * You should see the page reload and display the contents of the file
    * You need to edit this file. Right now it’s read-only though…
4. In the upper-right of the box you should see a number of editing icons. Click on the pencil
    * Edit title on line 16 from “Swiss Jekyll Theme” to: “Hi, I’m [firstname] [lastname]”
    * Change description on line 17 to a brief professional description or tagline for yourself
    * While you're here, fill in information for your:
        * Github username
        * Social link
        * Theme color of choice
    * Once you’re satisfied with your changes, scroll to the bottom. You should see a green “Commit” button. Click that. 
        * You should be transported back to the file view page and should see your edits reflected in the contents of that file
5. Navigate to your website’s url, which is probably https://<yourusername>.github.io/swiss
    * Changes should be visible but may take up to 5 minutes to show up
