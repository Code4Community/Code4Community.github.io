# COSI Workshop

## Week 1
[Week 1 Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1idhYj1mxXyDtjg6EK6kCBKM2exktuWy-XlfIkRKjZdY/edit?usp=sharing)

[Buckeye Catcher](https://c4cosu.com/buckeye-catch-em/)

#### Helpful Functions

| Function | Description |
|-----------|-----------|
| moveleft |  Moves the basket one spot to the left. |
| moveright | Moves the basket one spot to the right. |
| stay | Tells the basket to stay still for a second. |

#### How to Loop
* Forever Loop:
    * if you want to repeat an action forever, place it in a forever...end loop
    * For example: 
```
        forever
            moveleft
            moveright
        end
```

* X Times Loop:
    * if you want to repeat an action a certain number of times, place it in a X times...loop
        * X is the number of times you want the action to repeat
    * For example: 
```
        3 times
            moveleft
            moveleft
            moveright
        end
```

## Week 2
[Week 2 Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1elWlNQLDvoQMdXsXO1iuTZa18zFdpn_61PhJtkIdY7c/edit?usp=sharing)

[Brutus Ball](https://code4community.github.io/brutus-ball)

#### Helpful Functions

| Function | Description |
|-----------|-----------|
| move("left"), move("right"), move("up"), move("down") |  Moves the player in the specified direction. |
| throwFootball("left"), throwFootball("right"), throwFootball("up"), throwFootball("down") | The player throws the football in the given direction. |
| skip() | The player skips their current turn. |
| enemyX(), enemyY(), playerX(), playerY() | Gets the X or Y position of the character.  See the slides for more details! |


#### Variables
* Use variables when:
    * You want to store values, such as an important number, for later
    * You want to continually update a value
* For example: 
```
        var x = 4
        var y = 7
        var z = x + y
``` 
* After this short piece of code runs, z will store the value 11


#### Conditional Statements
* Conditions allow us to run a piece of code only under certain circumstances
    * An example of this would be only wanting to throw a football when we are vertically aligned with our enemy
* For example:
```
        if(playerY() == enemyY()) {
            throwFootball("right")
        }
``` 
* Now, our player will only throw the football when it could potentially hit the enemy
* Notice how we used == instead of =
    * When testing if two values are equal, always use ==
    * This way, = is reserved for assigning values to variables!


#### Conditional Testing with Loops
* Another example of conditional testing is when deciding how many times to run a loop
* This might be useful if we want to repeat an action until something happens
* For example:
```
        while(playerY() < enemyY()) {
            move("up")
        }
``` 
* Now, our player will move up the field as long as they are still below the enemy
