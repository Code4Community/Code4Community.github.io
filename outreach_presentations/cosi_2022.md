## Week 1
[Week 1 Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1idhYj1mxXyDtjg6EK6kCBKM2exktuWy-XlfIkRKjZdY/edit?usp=sharing)

[Buckeye Catcher](https://c4cosu.com/buckeye-catch-em/)

#### Helpful Functions

| Function | Description |
|-----------|-----------|
| moveleft |  Moves the basket one spot to the left. |
| moveright | Moves the basket one spot to the right. |
| stay | Tells the basket to stay still for a second. |

#### How to Loop
* Forever Loop:
    * if you want to repeat an action forever, place it in a forever...end loop
    * For example: 
```
        forever
            moveleft
            moveright
        end
```

* X Times Loop:
    * if you want to repeat an action a certain number of times, place it in a X times...loop
        * X is the number of times you want the action to repeat
    * For example: 
```
        3 times
            moveleft
            moveleft
            moveright
        end
```

## Week 2
[Week 2 Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1elWlNQLDvoQMdXsXO1iuTZa18zFdpn_61PhJtkIdY7c/edit?usp=sharing)

[Brutus Ball](https://code4community.github.io/brutus-ball)

[Tutorial 0: Machine Setup](https://c4cosu.com/tutorials/setup)


#### Helpful Functions

| Function | Description |
|-----------|-----------|
| move("left"), move("right"), move("up"), move("down") |  Moves the player in the specified direction. |
| throwFootball("left"), throwFootball("right"), throwFootball("up"), throwFootball("down") | The player throws the football in the given direction. |
| skip() | The player skips their current turn. |
| enemyX(), enemyY(), playerX(), playerY() | Gets the X or Y position of the character.  See the slides for more details! |


#### Variables
* Use variables when:
    * You want to store values, such as an important number, for later
    * You want to continually update a value
* For example: 
```
        var x = 4
        var y = 7
        var z = x + y
``` 
* After this short piece of code runs, z will store the value 11


#### Conditions
* Conditions allow us to run a piece of code only under certain circumstances
    * An example of this would be only wanting to throw a football when we are vertically aligned with our enemy
* For example:
```
        if(playerY() == enemyY()) {
            throwFootball("right")
        }
``` 
* Now, our player will only throw the football when it could potentially hit the enemy
* Notice how we used == instead of =
    * When testing if two values are equal, always use ==
    * This way, = is reserved for assigning values to variables!


#### Conditions with Loops
* Another example of conditional testing is when deciding how many times to run a loop
* This might be useful if we want to repeat an action until something happens
* For example:
```
        while(playerY() < enemyY()) {
            move("up")
        }
``` 
* Now, our player will move up the field as long as they are still below the enemy


## Week 3
[Week 3 Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lbd3DrWwG3ycWX8kxR9TvdqkcWEAi2m0eHeHkj7Az10/edit?usp=sharing)

[HTML and CSS Tutorial](https://c4cosu.com/tutorials/html-css)

#### Why do we need HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a website?
* Every webpage has to answer a few different questions before it can be displayed in your browser:
    * What am I displaying?
    * How am I displaying it?
    * How do I respond to user interaction?
* Each of these questions is answered by one of the languages of the web: HTML knows what to display, CSS knows how to display it, and JavaScript knows how to respond to user interaction

#### HTML Background
* HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language
* A markup language is a way of annotating, or “marking up” text with formatting information before it is displayed to a screen

#### CSS Background
* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets; it is also known as “styling”
* When you’re styling a webpage with CSS, you create rules which tell the browser how your webpage should be displayed
* Each rule consists of one or more selectors and one or more declarations

#### HTML Tags
* You “mark up” text in HTML using tags
* An opening tag looks like 
    ```
        <tag>
    ```
* A closing tag looks like 
    ```
        </tag>
    ```
* You will replace the text "tag" in each one with the specific tag name you would like to use

#### HTML Tag Example
* Let’s say that you want to display the text “Go Bucks”
* You might want to display that as a header, paragraph, or a link
* Your decision on that front would dictate which tag you would use
* If you want a header, then you’d put
    ```
         <h1>Go Bucks</h1>
    ```
* If you want a paragraph, then you’d put
    ```
         <p>Go Bucks</p>
    ```

#### Review the presentation or slides for an interactive activity with HTML!


## Week 4
[Week 4 Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kRnY-0sW1ygszRrYp98wZ79BT1dZxxTJNmIPVygHwSY/edit?usp=sharing)

[Bootstrap Setup](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/)

#### Bootstrap Background
* Bootstrap helps programmers with HTML / CSS development
* It focuses on simple styling and promoting responsive web design
* Essentially, it is a big library of pre-built styling and website components

#### Setting Up Bootstrap
* You will first need to add 3 lines of code into your HTML file
* The 3 lines of code are:
```
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
``` 
```
        <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-Zenh87qX5JnK2Jl0vWa8Ck2rdkQ2Bzep5IDxbcnCeuOxjzrPF/et3URy9Bv1WTRi" crossorigin="anonymous">
``` 
```
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-OERcA2EqjJCMA+/3y+gxIOqMEjwtxJY7qPCqsdltbNJuaOe923+mo//f6V8Qbsw3" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
``` 
* Reference the code from Step 2 in the "Bootstrap Setup" link above 
    * This will show you where each of these 3 lines should be pasted

#### New Website Additions
* Now that we are all set up, we will use Bootstrap to add the following new elements:
    * Navigation Bar
    * Additional "Hobbies" Page
    * Dropdown Menu

#### Follow along in the Week 4 presentation slides to improve your website from last week!
