            <p>
                MindUp! is a web application designed to aid <a href="https://csw.osu.edu/about/faculty-staff/faculty-directory/cash-scottye-ph-d/">Dr. Scottye Cash</a>, a professor in the College of Social Work, 
                in her research to help adolescents with mental health issues. Users will be able to log onto the website and see a personalized dashboard, where they will be able to view mental health resources
                related to life skills and well-being or take two different surveys, one correlated towards depression and the other towards anxiety. After taking a survey, the website will generate results and 
                resources tailored specifically to the user, including websites they may find helpful, music they may want to listen to, games, movies, and other suggestions.

            <p>
                We are using Node.js and React.js for the development of the application.  Thus far, we have implemented the database schema, set up basic networking so the frontend and backend can communicate, nearly completed the survey code, and have begun to design/create a page structure.
                In other words, there is still plenty of work to do!  We hope that you join us to work on a super cool project that will help others!
