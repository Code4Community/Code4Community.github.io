            <p>
                MindUp! is a mental health web application where users will take a survey of their current mental health state.  MindUp! will then provide articles, videos, and other resources to help the user.
                MindUp! is being created along with a study done by <a href="https://csw.osu.edu/about/faculty-staff/faculty-directory/cash-scottye-ph-d/">Dr. Scottye Cash</a> where homeless adolescents will use the application to test its effectiveness.

            <p>
                We are using Node.js and React.js for the development of the application.  Thus far, we have set up the basic networking between the front and back end, created the database scheme, nearly completed the survey code, and have begun to create a page strucutre.
                In other words, there is still plenty of work to do!  We hope that you join us to work on a super cool project that will help others!
