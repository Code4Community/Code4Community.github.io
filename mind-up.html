            <p>
                This is a web application designed to support people with mental health issues. Users will log onto the website and see a personalized dashboard where they can view resources related to mental health, life skills, and well-being. They can also take two different surveys which measure levels of depression and anxiety respectively. After taking a survey, the website will provide resources tailored specifically to the user. This may include websites, apps, music, games, and movies among other suggestions.

            <p>
                We are using the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack">MERN stack</a> (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) for our web application. Thus far, we have implemented the database schema, linked the front end to the back end, nearly completed the survey code, and created a page structure.
