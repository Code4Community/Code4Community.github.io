            <p>
                At Code 4 Community, our mission is to help our community through computer science. This can include
                teaching computer science to grade school students, working with researchers to develop applications to
                help those with mental illness, and much more! If you are interested in helping others through code,
                then we are the club for you!

                            The short answer is <strong>no</strong>. Though it helps to know a programming language or
                            two (because it helps you to learn new programming languages faster), you do not need to
                            know how to code. Through the programming tutorials we go through at the begginning of the
                            fall semester, self study, and learning by doing, you will be able to contribute to the
                            projects.

                            Everyone, if they know how to code or not, will learn something new through Code 4
                            Community, so come join us to learn something new and help others!

                            We have one 1.5 hour meeting per week. Moreover, if you participate in school outreach, we
                            have occasional outreach events that are generally about two hours long.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It is best to only miss a few meetings at most because, in general, every one is assigned a
                            task to complete. If one were to miss many meetings, then the club would have to reassign
                            the tasks effectively slowing development down.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In the end, we know schools comes first. All we can say is the less you come, the less we
                            can ensure you will be able to contribute.

                            Well, it depends if you are involved in school outreach or MindUp.

                            In school outreach, we spend our time coding 'modules' (which are the coding demos that we
                            demonstrate to students) and developing presentations to give to schools in the area.
                            <br><br>
                            In MindUp, we spend time learning new technologies to develop MindUp, reviewing other club
                            members' code, and, of course, coding!
