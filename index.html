            <p>
                At Code 4 Community, our mission is to help our community through computer science. This can include
                teaching computer science to grade school students, working with researchers to develop applications to
                help those with mental illness, and much more! If you are interested in helping others through code,
                then we are the club for you!

                            The short answer is <strong>no</strong>. Though it helps to know a programming language or
                            two (because it helps you learn new programming languages faster), you do not need to know
                            how to code. We will go through <a href="/tutorials">programming tutorials</a> at the
                            begginning of the fall semester. Additionally, you will learn via self study and by working
                            on projects!

                            We have one 90 minute meeting per week. Additionally, if you participate in Outreach, we
                            have occasional events that last for an hour or two.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is best to only miss a few meetings at most because, in general, every one is assigned a
                            task to complete. If one were to miss many meetings, then the club would have to reassign
                            the tasks effectively slowing development down.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, we know schools comes first. All we can say is the less you come, the less we
                            can ensure you will be able to contribute.

                            Well, it depends if you are involved in Outreach or MindUp.

                            In Outreach, we spend our time coding 'modules' (which are the coding demos that we demonstrate to students) and developing presentations to give to schools in the area.

                        <p>
                            In MindUp, we spend time learning new technologies to develop MindUp, reviewing other club members' code, and, of course, coding!
