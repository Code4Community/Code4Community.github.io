            <p>
                At Code 4 Community, our mission is to help the community around us through computer science. We have
                worked on
                several projects in the past, but our current primary project is local school STEM education. Over the
                past 4 years, Code 4 Community had worked to create learning games and tools to help teach middle school
                to high school students computer science principles. We have exciting plans to expand our teachable age
                group and create some really cool modules. OSU Students can sign up for our club with the button above.
                Teachers can read more about our presentations by clicking on the "For Teachers" tab in the menu bar. We
                look forward to working with you all!

                            The short answer is <strong>no</strong>. Though it helps to know a programming language or
                            two (because it helps you learn new programming languages faster), you do not need to know
                            how to code. We will go through <a href="/tutorials">programming tutorials</a> at the
                            begginning of the fall semester. Additionally, you will learn via self study and by working
                            on projects!

                            We have one 90 minute meeting per week. Additionally, if you participate in Outreach, we
                            have occasional events that last for an hour or two.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is best to only miss a few meetings at most because, in general, every one is assigned a
                            task to complete. If one were to miss many meetings, then the club would have to reassign
                            the tasks effectively slowing development down.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the end, we know schools comes first. All we can say is the less you come, the less we
                            can ensure you will be able to contribute.

                            In Outreach, we spend our time coding 'modules' (which are the coding demos that we
                            demonstrate to students) and developing presentations to give to schools in the area.

                            In MindUp, we spend time learning new technologies to develop MindUp, reviewing other club
                            members' code, and, of course, coding!
