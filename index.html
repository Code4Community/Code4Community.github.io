            <p>
                At Code 4 Community, our mission is to help our community through computer science. This can include
                teaching computer science to grade school students, working with researchers to develop applications to
                help those with mental illness, and much more! If you are interested in helping others through code,
                then we are the club for you!

                            The short answer is <strong>no</strong>. Though it helps to know a programming language or
                            two (because it helps you to learn new programming languages faster), you do not need to
                            know how to code. Through the programming tutorials we go through at the begginning of the
                            fall semester, self study, and learning by doing, you will be able to contribute to the
                            projects.
