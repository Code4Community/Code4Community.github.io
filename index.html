            <p>
                At Code 4 Community, our mission is to help the community around us through computer science. We are currently focused on creating and running STEM education workshops at local schools. Over the past 4 years, Code 4 Community has created learning games and tools to teach middle and high school students computer science principles. We have exciting plans to expand our teachable age group and create some really cool modules. Ohio State students can sign up for our club using the button above. Teachers can read more about our presentations by clicking on the "For Teachers" tab in the menu bar. We look forward to working with you all!

                            The short answer is <strong>no</strong>. Although knowledge of JavaScript is helpful, you do not need to know how to code. We will go through <a href="/tutorials">programming tutorials</a> at the beginning of the academic year. You will also learn by working on projects with other C4C members!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are an experienced programmer, we have plenty to offer for you too! You can develop your technical skills further by leading a project group or helping run our tutorials at the beginning of the academic year.

                    <div class="uk-accordion-content">
                        <p>
                            We have one 90-minute meeting per week. We also have outreach events on occasion; those usually last for an hour or two.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To get the most out of C4C, we recommend attending meetings regularly. It's difficult to learn how to program and become an effective contributor on a project if you miss too many meetings.

                            We spend most of our time coding learning modules which we present to local schools in educational workshops. You can see some examples on our GitHub!
