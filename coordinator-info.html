            <p>
                We strive to help the Columbus community through computer science outreach. During our weekly meetings
                we build learning modules. Then, we present them to students at local schools during our workshops.

            <p>
                We are looking for student volunteers to help coordinate our outreach events (workshops). This would
                involve finding new schools in the Columbus area for outreach, corresponding with old and new school
                contacts to plan outreach events, and working with club leadership when planning these events.

            <p>
                Anyone who is organized and has good people skills! You do not need to know how to code! This is a great resume builder for anyone looking to
                demonstrate that they value community service and have strong soft skills when speaking with prospective
                employers.
